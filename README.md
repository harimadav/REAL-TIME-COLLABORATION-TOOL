# REAL-TIME COLLABORATION TOOL

*COMPANY* : CODETECH IT SOLUTIONS

*NAME* : S HARI SHANKAR

*INTERN ID* : CT04DH297

*DOMAIN* : SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT

*DURATION* : 4 WEEKS

*MENTOR* : NEELA SANTHOSH



## 📌 Project Overview

This project is part of my internship at *CodTech IT Solutions* under *Task 3: Real-Time Collaboration Tool Development. The aim was to create a **Google Docs–like platform* that enables multiple users to collaborate on note-taking or coding in real-time.

The application is built using *HTML, **CSS, **JavaScript, **Flask, and **WebSocket* technology (via *Socket.IO*), ensuring seamless and instant updates across users.



## ⚙ How It Works

- The frontend UI is created using *HTML/CSS*, designed to be simple and user-friendly.
- Real-time collaboration is made possible using *WebSocket connections, handled via **Socket.IO*.
- *Flask* serves the backend logic and integrates with WebSocket events.
- Users can:
  - Open the platform in multiple tabs or devices.
  - See edits reflected instantly on all connected screens.
  - Save their collaborative notes as a .txt file for future use.

> Each keystroke is broadcasted to all connected users – creating a live, synced experience.
